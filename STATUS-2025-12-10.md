# Status Update - December 10, 2025

## Completed Today

### Projects + Threads Refactor (Complete)
Successfully restructured the application from flat Workspaces to hierarchical Projects containing Threads:
- Projects contain shared Resources and multiple Threads
- Each Thread has its own conversation/messages
- Implemented soft delete for threads (`deleted_at` column)
- Added `last_thread_id` to restore user's previous thread on project open

### Auto-Generated Thread Titles (Complete)
- New threads start as "New Thread"
- After first user message, Claude Haiku generates a 2-5 word contextual title
- Backend endpoint: `POST /projects/{project_id}/threads/{thread_id}/generate-title`
- Frontend calls this after receiving first assistant response

### Typewriter Animation for Thread Titles (Complete)
- When thread title is auto-generated, it animates character-by-character
- 30ms per character with 100ms initial delay
- Implemented `TypewriterTitle` component in `page.tsx`
- Works on both mobile (sheet view) and desktop (sidebar) layouts

## Key Files Modified

uvicorn api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
